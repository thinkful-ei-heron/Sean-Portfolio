            <p> I've always loved learning about computers and staying on top of the latest trends in technology. I became a Microsoft
                Certified Professional (MCP) during my first year of college, and maintain an active CompTIA A+ certification. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I get a great deal of satisfaction from programming, and I have experience with C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery,
                ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and PostgreSQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests include learning about new technology, watching a good documentary, listening to good music, being in the
                outdoors, meeting new people, great food, and adventure riding on my dual-sport motorcycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                I pride myself on the ability to solve problems, communicate well, and quickly adapt to change.
